This IoT Cybersecurity Vulnerabilities project is the first website I have built. I submitted this website as the final project in a cybersecurity risk management course. This project seeks to compile a variety of online sources to teach the viewer about IoT Cybersecurity and provide a small "database" of IoT cybersecurity breaches.
